        I create neat animated and interactive websites. I am usually working
        with agencies, startups, brands, associations and other freelancers. I
        have already worked with renowned clients such as: Jam3, Chanel, Cher
        Ami, La Phase 5, Funkhaus, Screen-club... I can help you build your
        website from scratch, or just add some cool UI effects afterhand using
        WebGL or plain JavaScript.
